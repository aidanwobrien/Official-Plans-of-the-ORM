# Official-Plans-of-the-ORM
A web map of the upper and lower tier municipalities on the Oak Ridges Moraine with URL links to the official plans of the region.

# Data Sources
All data in the webmap was retrieved from Ontario Geohub LIO and the regional municipalities websites. Data sources include the Upper Tier (https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/municipal-boundary-upper-tier-and-district/explore) and Lower and Single Tier municipalities layer (https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/lio::municipal-boundary-lower-and-single-tier/about) as well as the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Use Designation layer (https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/oak-ridges-moraine-orm-land-use-designation/explore).

# Web Map Functionalities

The Web Map was created using the qgis2web plugin. The web map has a few interactive functions.
1. You can measure distances using the measurement tool (in metric)
2. You can search for an address in the address search bar.
3. You can search for a lower tier municipality in the layer search bar.
4. You can toggle on and off layers by expanding the layer browser and selecting or deselecting a layer.
5. You can geolocate yourself using the location/pin button in the top left of the webmap.
6. The municipalities can be clicked on which will open the popup window for the municipality. Here you can find a URL link which will bring you to the Official Plan of that municipality.
